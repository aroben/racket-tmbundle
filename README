Racket TextMate Bundle

CREDITS
This repository is a fork of the work by Nicholas Kostelnik. Since the
repository was untouched for over 2 years and I needed some basic Racket
support in TextMate 2, I decided to create this fork and try to make it
functional.

DISCLAIMER
This is my first attempt at managing a TextMate Bundle, so things will be
pretty rough around the edges at times. But since I'll be using this bundle
myself for the next few months (at least), I hope that it soon will become
useful and stable enough for anyone to use. Feel free to provide me with
feedback of any kind.

INSTALL
To get this TextMate bundle functional using TextMate 2, run the following
commands in a Terminal:

$ mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/Avian/Bundles
$ cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Avian/Bundles
$ git clone https://github.com/christophevg/racket-tmbundle.git Racket.tmbundle
$ rm ~/Library/Caches/com.macromates.TextMate/BundlesIndex.binary

(See https://github.com/textmate/textmate/wiki/FAQ#known-limitations for more
 info on installing and managing Bundles under TextMate 2)

If you installed Racket from http://racket-lang.org and followed the
instructions, the CLI version of racket is in /Applications/Racket vx.y.z/bin.

I added a symbolic link to it from /usr/local/bin. You may choose to do it
otherwise ;-)

$ ln -s "/Applications/Racket v5.3.6/bin/racket" /usr/local/bin/racket
$ which racket
/usr/local/bin/racket

Now restart TextMate, make sure that /usr/local/bin is in the search path and
you should now have some basic editing support for Racket.
