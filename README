Racket TextMate Bundle

CREDITS
This repository is a fork of the work by Nicholas Kostelnik. Since the
repository was untouched for over 2 years and I needed some basic Racket
support in TextMate 2, I decided to create this fork and try to make it
functional.

DISCLAIMER
This is my first attempt at managing a TextMate Bundle, so things
will be pretty rough around the edges at times. But since I'll be using this
bundle myself for the next few months (at least), I hope that it soon will
become useful and stable enough for anyone to us. Feel free to provide me with
feedback of any kind.

INSTALL
To get this TextMate bundle functional using TextMate 2, run the following
commands in your Terminal:

$ mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/Avian/Bundles
$ cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Avian/Bundles
$ git clone https://github.com/christophevg/racket-tmbundle.git Racket.tmbundle
$ rm ~/Library/Caches/com.macromates.TextMate/BundlesIndex.binary

(See https://github.com/textmate/textmate/wiki/FAQ#known-limitations for more
 info on installing and managing Bundles under TextMate 2)

Now restart TextMate and your should now have Racket support.
